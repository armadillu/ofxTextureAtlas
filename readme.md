Requires ofxXmlSettings and my fork of [ofxRectangleUtils](https://github.com/armadillu/ofxRectangleUtils).

To run this, first create some atlases. Open up exampleCreate, add lots of images into bin/data/images/cats and run it; it will create some atlases into bin/data/textureCache

Then, to draw using the atlas, try the other example, exampleDraw. Copy the atlases created in bin/data/textureCache with exampleCreate into the bin/data/textureCache of exampleDraw, and run it. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
